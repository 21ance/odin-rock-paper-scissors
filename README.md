This is a rock paper scissors game using JavaScript - the user is playing against the computer.

HTML and CSS
    - The UI is split into three parts: (1)Header, (2)Main, and (3)Footer. Flexbox was utilized to achieve this layout.
    - The font-family 'Josefin Slab' was imported and applied on all texts.
    - So far I have not learned intermediate CSS styling. But with the help of Google, I was able to apply basic hover effects.

JavaScript
    - I was able to utilize DOM manipulation to modify HTML elements and ID. Now I see why JavaScript is a must to have a dynamic website!
    - Functions within functions, it was fun!
